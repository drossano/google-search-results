# Google Search Results

A recreation of the Google search results page as an optional project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)


# Reflections
This was my second project for The Odin Project to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML and CSS. After completing the Google Homepage project this felt much easier however there was much more content to replicate. Lookswise, I'm very happy with what I was able to do. On the code side of things I feel like I could have made my CSS more efficient and I definitely feel like I used too many ID's and classes. I also realized halfway through that in ce rtain cases I was using padding when I probably should have used margins.
